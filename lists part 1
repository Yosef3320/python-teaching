do you get tired of creating variables?
no need to worry, because lists can be many things!
if I put:
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
than it would have the same response as variables, it would say nothing.
it needs the brackets just like input and print do.
if I wanted to say just pasta then I could use print and say this:
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
print(food[1])
the way I know this beacause each thing in the list has a number from 0 till the rest of them like this
           0       1       2
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
but what if I want to add something?
than I could do append!for example:
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
food.append("beef")
this would make the list food also have beef in it!yum!!
