while loops can be quite difficult, but with this your gonna remember.
here is a example of a while loop:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
We are using variables combined with if and else and numbers!!
That's allot!! But I will teach you it!
In the example above, i is equal to one. The while i less than six thing means that when the variable i, difined as 1,is less than 6 he should do whatever is
under the colin.The print i means, oops, you already know! The i += 1 thing means i,difined as 1, gets another one every time.
Heres another example:
i = 6
while i > 1:
  print(i)
  i -= 1
This is the same thing as += and lessthan just the opposite. -= means the same as += just instead of plus, its minus.
