while loops can be quite difficult, but with this your gonna remember.
here is a example of a while loop:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
We are using variables combined with if and else and numbers!!
That's allot!! But I will teach you it!
In the example above, i is equal to one. The while i less than six thing means that when the variable i, difined as 1,is less than 6 he should do whatever is
under the colin.The print i means, oops, you already know! The i += 1 thing means i,difined as 1, gets another +1 every time.
Heres another example:
i = 6
while i > 1:
  print(i)
  i -= 1
This is the same thing as += and lessthan just the opposite. -= means the same as += just instead of plus, its minus.
But what if I want to do where it go's on forever?
You just put this:
while True:
  print(097)
Oh no now it go's on forever! heres how it is heplful, you use if and else!Heres and example:
while True:
  z = input("what do like most, universal, disney ,or fun spot?")
  if z == "universal"or z =="disney"or z =="fun spot":
    print("okay, good to know!")
    break
  else:
    input("what do like most, universal, disney ,or fun spot?")
The way this works is that it says that if the answer equals one of the above, then say: okay good to know!
and it will break out of the loop(break is only in loops, and or is used to make it also if they say this!)
But if I say something that it doesn't say above then it will ask me again!
