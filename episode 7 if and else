so, you having trouble making the computer do stuff only if stuff happen?
No problem, if and else can handle it!for example:
food = input("what is your favorite, disney, universal, or fun spot?")
if food == "disney" :
  print(oh, cool)
if food == "universal" :
  print(hey, me too!!)
if food == "fun spot" :
  print(what, that place is fruad spot!!)
So now, if I say disney it will say: oh,cool
if I say universal it will say:hey, me too!!
And so on.Remember its ==, not =.
REMEMBER THE TAB!!!
the colin is basically saying: hey this is what it equals!
