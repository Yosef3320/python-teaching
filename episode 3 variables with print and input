what if you want to make the variable actualy do something?
did you know print and input can say what the variable equals?
if I put this in:
food = "pizza"
print(food)
guess what it will say, it will say pizza!
with variables when you put them in stuff they're like numbers!
no need to have quatation marks around them!
you can also make variables equal to print and input!
for example:
food = input("so, what is your favorite food?")
But if you make variables equal to print or input, you also make the computer say what the variable is equal while difining it!
