def is to difine stuff like variables lists and tuples.
The way it is different is because you can make it equal to print and input, for example:
def pizza():
  print("peperoni")
then whenever I say pizza() it will say peperoni
you need to say the open and close perantaces after the name of the def.
if you want to make it say what the def equals then use print or input.
Never ever forget the tab it is very important same with the :
