the function print tells the computer to say whatever is in the quatation marks or double quatation marks
you also need ()
if I said:
print("hello world")
then it would say: hello world
and if you have numbers ONLY than it doesn't need quatation marks or double quatation marks, for example if I said:
print(12345678910) It would still work,now that doesn't mean you can't have quatation marks its just a extra tip.
If you get an error and you don't no why, maiby you put a capital P for print,well it has to be lowercase.
Also print doesn't let the person answer,and that's why I'm talking about input right now.
input is the same as print just leting the person answer.See you next time.
