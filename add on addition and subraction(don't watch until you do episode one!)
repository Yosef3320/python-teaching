if you want to do addition,subtraction,or multiplication, then here we go!
Here is an example:
print(20 + 18)
print(20 - 18)
This will actualy solve this!
What if I want it to input it?
Easy!All I need to do is this:
j = input("what is 5 - 5?")
if j == 0:
  print("correct")
else:
  print("nope")
and if I want it to do it until he answers correct then this:
while True:
  j = input("what is 5 - 5?")
  if j == 0:
    print("correct")
    break
  else:
    print("nope")
what if I wanted to do multiplacation, there 
is no key for that. Well with shift eight that is the multiplication sighn!
It looks like this:
*
What if want to do greaterthan and lessthan?
here is what you could put:
print(5 > 5)
print(1 < 5)
now for the 5 is greater than 5 it will say False, and for the 1 lessthan 5 it will say True!
heres a tip you can't do equals.
