welcome to part 2 of lists
hey what if you wanted to remove something?
then I use this function called pop!
for example:
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
food.pop(2)
this will delete turkey.It's the same number thing where each string has a number.
now,what if the some  stuff I difine are a number?
then make ONLY THE NUMBERS with no quatation marks.
what if the whole thing is numbers?
same thing as variables!
