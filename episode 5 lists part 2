welcome to part 2 of lists
hey what if you wanted to remove something?
then I use this function called pop!
for example:
food = ["pizza","pasta","turkey"]
food.pop(2)
this will delete turkey.It's the same number thing where each string has a number.
now,what if the some  stuff I difine are a number?
then make ONLY THE NUMBERS with no quatation marks.
what if the whole thing is numbers?
same thing as variables!
tuples are the same thing as lists just you can't change the strings and instead of brackets you use these:
()
